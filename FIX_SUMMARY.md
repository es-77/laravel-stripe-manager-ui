# React Duplicate Instance Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The package was causing the error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentDispatcher')
```

This occurred because React was being bundled into the package instead of being treated as an external dependency, creating multiple React instances in the consuming application.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Rollup Configuration (`rollup.config.js`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive external dependencies list
- ✅ Externalized all React-related imports using regex patterns
- ✅ Externalized `react/jsx-runtime` to prevent JSX transformation bundling
- ✅ Added all other dependencies as externals (axios, framer-motion, clsx, tailwind-merge)
- ✅ Added `exports: 'named'` for CommonJS compatibility

### 2. Updated Package Configuration (`package.json`)
- ✅ Added `peerDependenciesMeta` to explicitly mark React dependencies as required
- ✅ Added `sideEffects: ["*.css"]` for better tree-shaking
- ✅ Bumped version to 1.0.1

### 3. Added Documentation
- ✅ Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with solutions for common issues
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with troubleshooting section
- ✅ Created `.npmignore` for clean package distribution

### 4. Updated Changelog
- ✅ Documented all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

## Verification

The build was successfully completed and verified:

**ESM Build:** ✅ React is imported externally
```javascript
import{jsx as e,jsxs as a}from"react/jsx-runtime";
import{createContext as t,useContext as i,...}from"react";
```

**CommonJS Build:** ✅ React is required externally
```javascript
var e=require("react/jsx-runtime"),
s=require("react"),
t=require("axios"),...
```

## Next Steps for Publishing

### 1. Test the Package Locally
```bash
# In the package directory
npm run build

# Link the package locally
npm link

# In your React app
npm link laravel-stripe-manager-ui
```

### 2. Test in Your React App
```tsx
import { StripeManagerProvider, PlansList } from 'laravel-stripe-manager-ui';
import 'laravel-stripe-manager-ui/dist/index.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <StripeManagerProvider 
      baseUrl="https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe-manager"
      token="your_jwt_token"
    >
      <PlansList />
    </StripeManagerProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Publish to NPM
```bash
# Login to npm (if not already logged in)
npm login

# Publish the package
npm publish
```

### 4. Install in Your React App
```bash
# Unlink if you were testing locally
npm unlink laravel-stripe-manager-ui

# Install from npm
npm install laravel-stripe-manager-ui@latest
```

## If Issues Persist

If users still encounter the React duplicate instance error after updating:

### Solution 1: Clean Install
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Solution 2: For Webpack Users
Add to `webpack.config.js`:
```javascript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    react: path.resolve('./node_modules/react'),
    'react-dom': path.resolve('./node_modules/react-dom'),
  },
}
```

### Solution 3: For Vite Users
Add to `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
resolve: {
  dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom'],
}
```

### Solution 4: For Next.js Users
Add to `next.config.js`:
```javascript
webpack: (config) => {
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    react: path.resolve('./node_modules/react'),
    'react-dom': path.resolve('./node_modules/react-dom'),
  };
  return config;
}
```

## Files Changed

1. `rollup.config.js` - Fixed external dependencies
2. `package.json` - Added peer dependency metadata and version bump
3. `.npmignore` - Added for clean distribution
4. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - New comprehensive guide
5. `README.md` - Added troubleshooting section
6. `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented all changes

## Build Output Location

- `dist/index.js` - CommonJS build
- `dist/index.esm.js` - ES Module build
- `dist/index.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `dist/index.css` - Compiled styles

All builds are verified to properly externalize React! ✅
